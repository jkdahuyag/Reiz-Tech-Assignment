A clock hands lesser angle calculator console app and a hierarchical structure depth calculator for Reiz Tech's Assignment 

<h3>Clock Hands Lesse Angle Calculator</h3>
Calculates the smaller angle between the two clock hands in a given time. The user can input the hours and minutes, and the app will output the smaller angle.
<h3>Hierarchical Structure</h3>
<p>Contains classes called HierarchicalStructure and Branch. </p>
<p>- A branch is an object that also contains a list of branches. </p>
<p>- The HierachicalStructure class has a property Root that has a type of Branch, which is the parent of all branches.</p>
<p>- The depth of the structure is equal to how many layers of branches there are.</p>
<p>- The depth is calculated using a recursive method.</p>
<p>The classes are tested using Unit Tests in the Tests.cs file</p>

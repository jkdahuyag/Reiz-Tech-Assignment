A clock hands lesser angle calculator console app and a hierarchical structure depth calculator for Reiz Tech's Assignment 

<h3>Clock Hands Lesse Angle Calculator</h3>
Calculates the smaller angle between the two clock hands in a given time. The user can input the hours and minutes, and the app will output the smaller angle.
<h3>Hierarchical Structure</h3>
<p>Contains classes called HierarchicalStructure and Branch. </p>
<ul>
  <li> A branch is an object that also contains a list of branches. </li>
  <li> The HierachicalStructure class has a property Root that has a type of Branch, which is the parent of all branches.</li>
  <li> The depth of the structure is equal to how many layers of branches there are.</li>
  <li> The depth is calculated using a recursive method.</li>
</ul>
<p>The classes are tested using Unit Tests in the Tests.cs file</p>
<p>Nuget Packages installed for unit testing:</p>
<ul>
  <li> NUnit (3.13.3)</li>
  <li> NUnit3TestAdapter (4.4.2)</li>
